      <p align=justify>My name is Karin van Homelen, I'm 34 years old, and I'm currently active as a sales engineer at AUMA Benelux B.V. In my spare time I try to teach myself some programming skills. Besides reading books, playing video games, and watching films and series of course.
        Occasionally I even go outside meeting friends, or just enjoying a relaxing walk or run.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>In 2005 I moved from Boxtel to Leiden to start my archaeology studies at Leiden University. I absolutely loved it. I specialized in (early)prehistory and computer applications. I did field work in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Republic
          of Georgia. In 2008-2009 I was the secretary of study association 'Johan Picardt' (Johan Picardt leeft!). All this I topped of with my Master thesis about Paleolithic flint. Never knew I could get so excited
          about tiny pieces of stone.</p>

        <h3>Working experience</h3>
        <p>Alas I graduated in 2011 during the financial crisis. Not the best time to find work in archeology. As a way of getting by I started doing administrative work at AUMA Benelux B.V., a company that sells electric actuators. Good I get any
          further from archaeology? Years went by, I forgot about my tiny pieces of stone and gradually I began to learn more about these actuators. Eventually I got so excited that I took courses in electrical engineering and mechatronics. This didn't got unnoticed and eventually in 2018 they
          moved me to the technical sales department, where I still am!</p>
